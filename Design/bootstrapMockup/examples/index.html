        <p>
            The Dead Man Walking is the case of an event in Jarrel, Texas 
            where two tornados touched the ground at the same time,
            forming what appeared to be "two legs". This phenomena was
            captured in a photo. 
            <a href="https://youtu.be/JK7XOMTs6j8?si=IK53NISmQ0Lt3rJj">Heres a YouTube video about this case</a>

        <h3>The Enhanced Fujita Scale</h3>
        <p>
            The Enhanced Fujita scale (EF) is a basis of which
            we classify tornados strength. Below is a table
            that shows the differences.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>EF0 - 65-85 mph wind gusts</li>
            <li>EF1 - 86-110 mph wind gusts</li>
            <li>EF2 - 111-135 mph wind gusts</li>
            <li>EF3 - 136-165 mph wind gusts</li>
            <li>EF4 - 166-200 mph wind gusts</li>
            <li>EF5 - Over 200 mph wind gusts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Why the Enhanced Fujita scale as opposed to the original scale?
            well, there are a few reasons as to why...
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>No "damage indicators"</li>
            <li>No account for construction quality or variability</li>
            <li>No definitive correlation between damage and wind speed</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This new scale has been used as the new basis for categorizing tornados
            many times! Let's have a quick look at what each level brings in terms of
            damage...
